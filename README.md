# Adding Elements to a List with Incrementing Sum

This project demonstrates adding elements to a list with increasing font size when the element's number is divisible by 3. It showcases basic HTML and JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional formatting.

## Installation

1. Download the project's HTML file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/19Archmiel88/Incremental-List-Elements/blob/master/index.html


2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

## Running

1. Click the button labeled "Add an element to the list, and the sum increases by 5".

2. Observe the addition of a new element to the list.

3. Notice the increased font size of elements whose number is divisible by 3.

## Script Details

The JavaScript script performs the following actions:

1. Initializes the `number` variable to 1.

2. Retrieves the button and the unordered list (`ul`) from the HTML elements.

3. Listens for a click event on the button.

4. Upon clicking the button, it creates a new list item (`li`) and assigns it the current value of `number`.

5. If the value of `number` is divisible by 3, it adds the "big" class to the list item, increasing its font size to 40px.

6. Increments the `number` by 5.

This project serves as an example of adding elements to a list and modifying their appearance based on specific conditions.
